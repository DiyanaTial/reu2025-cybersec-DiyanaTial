## Mentor(s)
- Dianxing Xu
- Vladislav Dubrovenski

## Project Summary
This project focuses on enhancing the security of Large Language Model (LLM) agents by identifying and mitigating potential code vulnerabilities that arise in their design and deployment. The objective is to analyze common security flaws in LLM-based agents, such as prompt injection, code execution exploits, and data leakage, and to develop robust strategies and best practices to safeguard these agents against such threats. Using tools like Hugging Face transformers, Python 3.x, and AutoGen, the project aims to build secure, resilient LLM agents capable of safe interaction in real-world applications. 

## Tools and Models Used
- Hugging Face transformers
- Python 3.x
- AutoGen
